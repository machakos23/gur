Gurbani Automatic Speech Recognition

[Testset](https://archive.org/details/test.tar_202112) available on archive.org. The archive includes the labelled audio and the test results.

A working model is deployed at [anaad.xyz](https://anaad.xyz) (for best results use audio clips of 20-30s in duration). Nb. this model does not currently do normalization and silence removal preprocessing, which was done with all test data. This will improve model performance and will be added shortly. Expect around 90% accuracy for the moment.

Instructions on how to download and use the final trained pytorch model and reproduce the test results will be added after the paper is published.
